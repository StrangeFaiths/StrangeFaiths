The sun radiated high above the sky onto the shifting sea. Few clouds blocked the sun leaving a wave of heat on the surface of the water, yet there was a small chill in the wind. Salt filled the air.

A lone man in a strawhat walked into town. He carried a bucket of fish.


A boat rocked back and forth according to the waves and the winds. There sat a lone man who held a long rod with a reel. The rod was primitive, with merely string and sturdy wood, but fulfilled it's purpose. There beside it, a similar rod, but smaller in size. The wind breezed through the fisher's dark with few grey strands and the white shirt that was held together by only a few stiches. 

The man lied stretched down across the boat with a straw hat ontop of his head. Sun seeped through the cracks of the weave, but not enough to ruin a midday nap and a recovery from a hangover.

A shadow cast over the fisher's eyes before disappearing and appearing again. He awoke from the annoyance and looked above. There he saw the shadow of seabird fly above his boat. 

"Strange, they don't usually come out this-" He paused and looked closer at the bird. 

It's talons held onto a metal object. The bird vanished into the sunlight. A small glimmer blinked across the sky. Rising up, the fisherman reach out catching the small object in his hands.

The man inspected it confused. In his hands, a medallion engraved with words of the old tongue, "At ob martyrium honesta". It's center was hollow with a coin-sized space. Arcane energy emitted along the edges and within the hollow area. Flipping the meddallion, he found a distinct name engraved, "Nobilias".

Placing his strawhat back on his head, the fisherman sat in silence and stared out into the sea. The salt and brine left a bitter stench in the air.

"Couriers?" 

The elder spotted three figures in the distance. On their backs, were human shaped figures. He turned around towards his wife. "Do you know of anyone in the war?"

Without a glance from her filleting, she shook her head. Several fish stacked ontop of the edge of the board. Each chop slammed down with great and precise force, no part left unused. 

The elder walked out near the dirt road and waved to the three.

"Welcome you three to our humble village. We know of no soldiers."

They spoke in exhausted unison. "By the divine decree of the templars, we seek the one of the Nobilas family. In order to rightly, return what has been taken from them. If not returned, our lives in turn."

The elder stood baffled, "Nobilas." 

The three gave a dead stare to the elder.

"Child, I see," The old man spoke under his breath and looked up. "Come. I'll lead you there. He lives a fair distance from here."

The old man walked at a strangely brisk pace. Those in town stared at the trio that followed behind him.

Huts scattered about the beach. Men carried racks of fish. Wives hacked and skewered away at the fresh catches. Children played about the sand with sticks and straw.

With stares drawn at them. The four walked past the town and into the outskirts of a small forest. The forest held few trees, but was home to many woodland creatures. They trudged through the pathway until they saw a beach.

Seashells scatter about. Seagulls circled around the vast saltwaters.

Two huts stared at the ocean. 

One had old, but maintained walls and floorboards. The roof was covered with old hay that began to sink under. A small campfire lied at the front. Two wooden poles and a line that connected them held few smoked fish at the side of the house.

The other had wood walls rotted green with few openings and a hay roof poked with holes. Small sea wretches hid in the crevices within the floor boards. A campfire that still smoked sat in front of the house. Empty sticks and sticks with cooked fish stuck out of the ground around the camp.

Two children played about in the sand. A single man laid back against the wall of the decripit hut. His eyes shut closed with small grains of sand along the edges. His wife sat in the shade looking at the sea. In his hand was an empty bottle, where several empty ones accompanied it on the sand. 

He heard faint steps approaching him. Unfazed, he merely turned his back away 

"Trisus." An old gravelly voice spoke behind him.

Natia, Trisus' wife, slapped his leg. 

Trisus' fingers twitched, but he did not turn. Trisus lifted his bottle and inspected the writing before placing it on his mouth and raising it.

"Apologies Elder." Natia hung her head down. "What news do you bring?"

"We have couriers." The voice spoke again, "They've come to return for Adio Nobilias."

Natia's eyes widened. Trisus finished his bottle and spun around. "You're not jesting?"

There greeted him the face of the elder whose face shriveled at the musk of wine that permeated the hut. Behind him were three hooded figures. One was a tall woman, another a monstrously sized man, and the last a thin man. Of the three, two hoisted long wooden boxes upon their backs.

The elder gently shook his head. "Sorry, I'll leave these three in the hands of your family."

Trisus shot a confused look. "He had a-"

Looking at him in the eye, the elder nodded quietly. "Adio has done better for himself. Please give condolences on behalf of the village."

Without another word, the elder walked back to the village.

With bucket in hand, a fisher tugged a small wooden boat ashore. His straw hat fluttered in the wind. The air was colder. He looked up and grimaced. Three couriers stood waiting by the entrance of his hut along with Trisus.

"I'll take care of it Adio." Trisus reached out his hand. "Tend to your matters."

Adio smiled with dead eyes and handed a line of fish to Trisus.

"When the sunsets, come. Eating may be better with compa-" The drunk stopped and shook his head. He placed the fish alongside the campfire and walked into his hut.

Darkness engulfed with a small campfire emitting from the center. A pipe illuminated the man's face as smoke exhaled his nose. He patted the ground and pointed across the campfire. The three sat lined up next to each other, huddled among the flame.

"Before we get to the ritual," He produced a medallion into his hand. "I must ask. Who are the names of my couriers and what are your crimes?"

The man in the left glanced up with baggy eyes. His body large and very well built. Long brown hair grew down past his shoulders. A small beard formed around the contours of his chin. Speaking with a tiresome voice, he answers, "Zedek. Crime murder, of the first Degree."

The woman in the middle leaned forward. Her hardened bronze skin fit with her black hair that dropped to her waist. Although smaller than the man next to her, her muscles were extraordinarily defined. She responded thick with her accent. "Cahira, 'Omicide, Prisona o' Wa'"

The man on the right sat upwards with a brisk posture. His head held high. Flowing brown locks of hair tangled together on his head. An unkept mustache frizzled on top of his lips. His face and body were thin and pale. "Othos, Blackmail, Bribery, Embezzlement, Extortion, Forgery, Fraud, Lacerny. To name a few."

Adio stared at the fire. "When you finish your rites, your bodies will be cleansed of the weight of sin."

Zedek spoke, his voice rumbled, "What would our bodies be cleansed of? They are merely a vessel. Our souls are still tainted by our crimes."

"I see." Adio stared silently at the ground. He gestured torwards the end of the room. "Please, set it down."

The three set down the casket on the wood flooring.

The fisherman leaned over the lid. Carefully, he inspected the engravings. Each distinguished a merit during service.

His hands traced through each carving, Extraordinary Bravery, Conduction of God's Will, Distinguished Zealotry, Honorable Martyrdom.

Adio looked down at the medallion in his hands. Fitting a silver coin into the slot, he place it upon the centerpiece of the casket. The center glowed yellow. The light slowly lit the crevices of the engravings before fading away.

The three incanted in unision. Tattoos upon Zedik glowed and faded.

The fisherman stared at the casket. His arms felt heavy as if dragged by a full net. His heart ached as if crushed by the ocean's weight and his gut wretched.

With a deep breath, he opened the wooden box. There lied a young man nearly unfamiliar to the old man's eyes. The young man's eyes gently closed and short, brown hair neatly trimmed. His muscles were chiseled.

Adio gazed at the scarring. His eyes traced the contours of the lines. His hands pulsed in pain as each memory returned to him. The strong nostalgic smell of wine permeated the air. He ran his hands through his hair and gripped every lock. 

The fisherman rubbed his arms against his face. With a large sniffle, he kissed his fingers and placed them onto the deceased.

The sun had just fallen under the horizon.

Hand on cheek, Trisus watched fish simmering on the fire. His children played near the campfire and his wife flipped the fish as it browned.

Natia nudged his arm.

Turning, Trisus saw in the corner of his eyes a lone figure walking torwards camp.

Adio carried a line full with cooked fish.

"We didn't think you'd come at all." Natia spoke.

"I thought that the company would be nice. I brought some gifts as well." Adio placed two sticks across the fire and hung the fish down. "Before they left, one of them had told me. That he had killed his sister's murderer. He avenged his sister, but he could not repent. Though, not through god, but allowing such a thing to happen to his sister." 

The couple sat silently, watching at Adio, who faced the sea.

"He had made me realizee, no matter how long I try to walk onto the righteousp path." Looking at the waters lit underneath the moonlight, the fisher faintly smiled. "For even if I repent, my son has returned home, with deaf ears, and closed eyes."
