The nightsky lit up in bright-orange. Torches held up by many villagers. Some villages held farming tools of various uses.




Leal began to run torwards the flickering lights.

Leal halted and turned. He looked down at the knife injected into his back. "Zita?"

Leal's body collapsed onto the ground.

"Stinking rotten couriers. Look at what you've made me done." Zita's legs gave, her body slammed onto the ground. "What faith do I have left?"

"What faith do I have left on this wretched farm? What faith do I have left in my father? What faith do I have left..." She held up her hands, blood drooled down. She looked up at the stunned couiers. "Go. I'll test mine just as he had."

Zedik and Othos turned away, but Cahira stared at the girl.

She sat over the coffin, caressing it. Blood smothered the surface.

Zedik called out to Cahira, but she would not budge.

Cahira resolved. "We must take her. We have to take her back!"

Othos grabbed her shoulders and pressed her against the hard bark of a tree. His eye's widened. "You Bellian dog! Why are you here? If you wanted to die with your brothers and sisters, you should've fought to your death for your god's glory, instead here you are. Instead you question your faith, you are among us those who are willing to sacrifice ourself for our god. Did you join us to experience our glory or for your own selfishness?"



"Your nation raised you as mere meat puppets, yet here you are worse than your own country's scum." Othos scowled "Perhaps you should've died among your peers. At least your body would've been a good shield."

Cahira glanced back. Her silhouette faded as what left of her was engulfed by the light of torches.
