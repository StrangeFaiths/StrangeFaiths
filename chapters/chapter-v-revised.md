Adio awoke from his slumber. Scratching his grey hair, he rose from his hay bed and stretched. He peered over to the hearth. Smoked fish hung underneath the dying fire. 

Out of three plates, he picked two and set them on the table. A piece of fish fell on his stained brown shorts. Grumbling, he picked it up and checked the rip on his white shirt. The fisherman picked up his fishing rods and coin pouch. 

>> He inspects his fishing rod and it has a broken line.

Before stepping out, he peered over to his cabinet full of dusty liqour bottles. With a pained smile, he picked one up and left.

The sun had barely risen from the sea. The air was cold with morning dew and salt. Adio stepped onto the cold sand, and set his rods onto his boat. Turning around, he inspected the outside of his home. A hollow sound came upon knocking upon the wooden walls. Leaving holes, hay slipped down the roof exposing the wood base. Adio sighed and strolled into the forest.

Standing on the outskirts of a forest, Adio readied himself. Just 50 steps ahead was a fishing village. 
Thoughts of the stares he would receive held him back. With a deep breath, the fisherman stepped forward.

The first villager caught eyes with him. With the best smile he could force, Adio waved. The man scowled and continued on.

Standing on the outskirts of the forest, Adio peered at the village before him. Huts circled around the townsquare. Wives filleted fish, children chased each other, and men carried catches and wood.

With a deep breath and a forced smile, Adio paced into the village. Eyes gathered upon him, followed by whispers. The fisherman forced a smiled and waved at all he passed. The whispers only grew louder as he 

>> Adio buys from the shopkeeper, lines and

The shopkeeper's eyes followed Adio. His voice was tense. "Tell me what you need, take it, and leave. Having your ilk here is bad for business."

"New lines, please."

A man lied on the ground. Several bottles of liqour scattered around him. The thick scent of wine emitted from him. The drunk wore tattered brown rags. His grey beard grew down to his chest, and his grey-brown hair was down to his shoulders.

The fisherman tapped the drunk's shoulder and placed down a bottle of wine. "Trisus, here's one for today." 


The shopkeeper returned with a roll of string. He frowns. "You feed that drunkard everyday and he'll come back like a stray dog. Are you trying to redeem yourself in the face of god?"

"Repenting is part of god's teachings." Adio turned. "You may all say what you will about me. Forgiveness is not up to you, me, or god."

With a toothy grin, Trisus rises and roughly pats Adio's back. The two walk out of the village.

"Bless your kind heart, Adio." He drinks from his bottle, "They like to spread rumors don't they? No matter what you and I do, we're always scum at the bottom of their soles." 

"They treat you as such because you live that way. What I have done is much worse, and I shall live with that scar until I am forgiven." Adio patted his friend's shoulder and faintly smiled. "Come by my hut for dinner. I have a good feeling about today's catch."

"" ""

A large commotion gathered among the villagers. All huddled around the entrance of the village. They push and lean against each other for a peek.

Adio shrugs indifferently and leaves to the forest. "Tell me about it later. I've received enough ire today."

The village elder pushed through the crowd. Three figures stood at the gates. Their backs hoisted large wooden coffins.

"Welcome, Couriers." The village elder announced. "I apologize for the commotion. Our humble village do not have any soldiers off to the war. If I may ask, to where are you delivering to?"

They spoke in exhausted unison. "By the decree of the templars, we seek one of the Nobilas family. In order to return what has been taken from them."

The village erupted in chatter.

The elder taps the back of his cleaver onto a table. ""

"Allow me Elder ****." Trisus rose and patted the dirt off his rags.

"Drunkard, what kind of man are we delivering to?" Othos asked. 

Trisus didn't speak. He continued hiking on the trail.

"If we were living at the capital, a man that seems so villified by his community would be put to death or to the rites." Othos turned to Cahira. "Do you outlanders do it differently?"

Cahira spoke with a thick accent, "Man like that fight for his life. If he live, he live. If he die, he die."

"What about you Zedik?" Othos turned to the other courier. "Do our countrymen do the same?"

"A village wouldn't put a man like that to death." Zedik replied. "They would ostracized a man who shamed their village. The thought of death would linger in the thoughts of the people."

"So you're close to home Courier." Trisus pondered. "I wonder how serious your crime was that you were nearly put to execution."

"Did my" Adio gazed at the sky. "Come would you like a drink Trisus?"
