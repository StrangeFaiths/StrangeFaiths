Adio awoke from his slumber. Scratching his grey hair, he rose from his hay bed and stretched. He peered over to the hearth. Smoked fish hung underneath a dying fire. He walked to his cabinet and grabbed two plates from a set of three. Plucking a fish along the way, he sat down and ate. A piece fell on his stained brown shorts. Grumbling, he picked it up and inspected his attire. A large rip ran on his white shirt from his neck to his armpit. 

Finishing his breakfast, Adio picked up his fishing rods and donned a straw hat. Before stepping out, the fisherman peered over to his cabinet full of dusty liqour bottles. With a frown, he picked one up and left.

The sun had barely risen from the sea. The air was cold with morning dew and salt. Adio stepped onto the cool sand, and set his rods onto his boat. With a sigh, he strolled into the forest.

The mud was moist on his feet. The fisherman walked along an unbeaten path. At the end of the path was a single grave. It was marked with a wooden cross and decorated with various forest flowers. Sitting in front of the grave, he bows his head. 

    "Hello dear, it's been a while. Today marks the 10th autumn since my last drink. Luc hasn't returned yet. I pray everyday for his safe arrival, but I-..."

    "I understand if he doesn't forgive me. But I hope that he returns for you."

After saying prayers, Adio heads off.

Standing on the outskirts of a forest, Adio readied himself. Just 50 steps ahead was a village. Thoughts of the stares he would receive held him back. He took deep breaths. Stengthening his resolve, the fisherman stepped forward.

The first villager caught eyes with him. With the best smile he could force, Adio waved. The man scowled and continued on.

Standing on the outskirts of the forest, Adio peered at the village before him. Huts circled around the townsquare. Wives filleted fish, children chased each other, and men carried catches and wood.

With a deep breath and a forced smile, Adio paced into the village. Eyes gathered upon him, followed by whispers. The fisherman forced a smiled and waved at all he passed. The whispers only grew louder as he 

>> Adio buys from the shopkeeper, lines and

The shopkeeper's eyes followed Adio. 

"New lines, please."

The shopkeeper walked into his hut.

A man lied on the ground. Several bottles of liqour scattered around him. The thick scent of wine emitted from him. The drunk wore tattered brown rags. His grey beard grew down to his chest, and his grey-brown hair was down to his shoulders.

The fisherman tapped the drunk's shoulder and placed down a bottle of wine. "Trisus, here's one for today." 

    "Blessin's for ya kind heart Adio."


The shopkeeper returned with a roll of string. He handed the string to Adio. As Adio grasped it, the shopkeeper didn't let go.

    "Why are you feeding that beggar Adio?"

    "They say charity is a virtue of god, so I wanted to express my virtues."

    "Tell me Adio. Has your son returned?"

    Adio fell silent.

    "Do you have time to worry about virtues?"

    "I have prayed everyday for his return."

    "Praying? How many years has it been Adio?"

    "I'm sorry I didn't mean to-."

    "Leave."

The fisherman left.

Ignoring the stares, Adio walked to the outskirts of the village. A hand slapped his back. 

With a toothy grin, Trisus slaps Adio's back again.

    "Sorry I'm givin' ya trouble. I've never seen 'em like that. " 

    "I do this because I want to. "


"Come by my hut for dinner. I have a good feeling about today's catch."

"" ""

A large commotion gathered among the villagers. All huddled around the entrance of the village. They push and lean against each other for a peek.

Adio shrugs indifferently and leaves to the forest. "Tell me about it later. I've received enough ire today."

The village elder pushed through the crowd. Three figures stood at the gates. Their backs hoisted large wooden coffins.

"Welcome, Couriers." The village elder announced. "Apologies for the commotion. Our humble village has no soldiers at the war. If I may ask, to where are you delivering to?"

They spoke in exhausted unison. "By the decree of the templars, we seek one of the Nobilas family. In order to return what has been taken from them."

The village erupted in chatter.

The elder tapped the back of his cleaver onto a table. "Would anyone volunteer to guide these couriers to Adio's hut?"

The crowd was silent. Stares scanned around for anyone willing. A lone man walked forward.

"Allow me."

Trisus patted the dirt off his rags.

"Drunkard, what kind of man are we delivering to?" Othos asked. 

Trisus didn't speak. He continued hiking on the trail.

"If we were living at the capital, a man that seems so villified by his community would be put to death or to the rites." Othos turned to Cahira. "Do you outlanders do it differently?"

Cahira spoke with a thick accent, "Man like that fight for his life. If he live, he live. If he die, he die."

"What about you Zedik?" Othos turned to the other courier. "Do our countrymen do the same?"

"A village wouldn't put a man like that to death." Zedik replied. "They would ostracized a man who shamed their village. The thought of death would linger in the thoughts of the people."

"So you're close to home Courier." Trisus pondered. "I wonder how serious your crime was that you were nearly put to execution."

"Did my" Adio gazed at the sky. "Come would you like a drink Trisus?"
