## Divine Punishment
Exceptional Criminals are given the choice of their punishment, death or the divine voyage.

## Coffin
Coffins are sent to the families/friends of the deceased from the war. Each coffin is distinctly unique in their shape, and are enchanted by a pact. The pact set allows the body to be returned to the family/friends either through physical means or magical means. Initially the coffin is closed, a tax of one silver coin is required to complete the ceremony and open the coffin.

## Bodybinding
A courier's body is binded to another body as a forced pact. Markings manifest onto their body and cannot be removed until the proper ceremony of body is returned. Should the pact be unfulfilled in anyway the courier's body will be sent straight to hell whereas the deceased will be sent to the coffin of their family/friends. 

Bodybinding is done to prevent abandoning of one's divine duty. If the body of the deceased is 20 feet away from the courier, the courier's body will be used a tribute to send the deceased back to their family/friends. Likewise, severing of limbs of the body will result in the courier's corrpesonding flesh to be magically severed as a replacement to maintain the body's wholeness.

## Two Bodies in one
Should one's body be insufficent enough to return the body to it's physical form. Their soul is condemned to damnation instead.

## Voyage of Three
Just as the three templars had journeyed together, three couriers begin voyage together. Each of them are dependent on each other for survival due to body binding.

## Delivery
Families give blood to receive divine blessing. Upon accepting the pact, they are protected from those who are binded to their deceased until the pact is finished. Should they die naturally along the way, their deceased are unbinded and are required to bury the body where they are at.

## Pact Fulfilled
A pact's fulfillment is based off of two assurances given. The voluntary sacrifice of blood and the corpse tax marked by a special coin sent to the families. Once blood has been given voluntarily and dripped over the corpse, the coin must be placed above the slot on the corpse. Upon completion the respective courier will be released from their binding.

## Voyage's End
Upon the end of the voyage, sins are forgiven. The three must return back to the capital to receive their divine blessing. Once received, the three are exemplified. Afterwards, they are free to do what they wish, though are granted holy seat as templars.
