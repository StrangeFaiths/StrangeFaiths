# Templar's Speech

A trio of well-dressed men walked onto stage. The head templar walked forward to the podium.

"Man. Woman." He paused. "Sinner."

His voice boomed across the white marble square that stretched across the horizon. 3000 robed men and women huddled in front of the large podium. He pointed behind him. Six titanic pillars overseered the large crowd. It's shadow loomed engulfing the entire body of people.

"Why have you chosen this path? What lies ahead is beyond your comprehension, beyond your decision, and beyond your fate. What makes you wish to face divinity?"

The crowd began to stir in anger. Fist raised, many jeered at the three. 

"In our time of crusade, we neglect our fallen. We neglect those who await them. Sinners, couriers, what connects us to the fallen?"

Profanities thrown across the square. Some approached the trio with fists.

The templar clutched his jaw. His peer followed with his arm and the other with his leg. They ripped apart their inanimate limbs and raised them in the air. "The sacrifices they had made for us are lessons we learn from them." 

The crowd fell silent. Yells and screams died into hush whispers. 

The templars reattached their limbs.


"Go onward to your journey, couriers, may the Divinity have mercy upon you."
